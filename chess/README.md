# Chess Game (Pure Python)

This is a simple, terminal-based chess game written entirely in **pure Python** â€” no external libraries, no GUI, just good old console chess to demonstrate my coding skills and Clean Code principles.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

Just run the `main.py` file:

```bash
python3 main.py
